# movingSnowman

## Project Overview
This is the moving snowman project. This project was created in JavaFX(a GUI for Java) and it allows you to move a snowman using the arrown keys on your keyboard! 


## How I complete the completed the project? 
1. The Professor provided most of the code as it was an assignment, however, I did have to try to debug the code and pinpoint where some issues arose when running the code. I did use [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/java/) to help me with understanding the basics of each line of code and to understand where issues like actually moving the snowman and how to change the color of the buttons!
